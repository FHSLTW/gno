I used Brave browser and PageSaved to take snapshots of webpages, as PDF files
are known to have vulerabilities that can surely be used to root your computer
and track you.

Do not trust Chrome, nor Firefox.

Do not use Google, but prefer DuckDuckGo.

When that fails, try Yandex.

Whether Brave can be trusted I do not know.
