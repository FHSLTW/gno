# Gno.land Constitution

XXX builds upon MANIFESTO.md at date of launch.
XXX the constitution will be updated solely by NT,LLC until $GNOT is
tranferrable; thereafter it will be governed by the rest of this document.

## User Rights

XXX freedoms, privacy, limitations

## Blockchain Data Regulations

### Regulation: Porn and Gore

### Regulation: Hate Speech

### Regulation: Misinformation

### Regulation: Artificial Intelligence

### Regulation: Native and Application Tokens

### Regulation: Tokens and Memcoins

### Regulation: Audits

GovDAO is responsible for ensuring that GnoWeb and Gno.land track audit reports
of all code uploaded to Gno as well as the code of the blockchain and VM
itself.

All auditors must be "qualified"; they must be vetted and whitelisted by GovDAO
or NT,LLC on a Gno.land _Auditor and Audit Registry Realm_ managed
by GovDAO. This is to prevent malicious audit reports from confusing and
exploiting users.

Each auditing entity must be registered with general information such as the
jusisdiction of the auditing entity and the public identity of its chief
executives and significant owners (more than 10%) of the auditing entity. If
the auditing entity is a DAO the citizenship and residence of its chief
executives and significant owners (if any) as well as that of everyone involved
in the auditing contract must be declared. If any auditor or member of an
auditing entity is based on AI, the AI source as well as model weights or
training data must be made available with its commit hash hosted on Gno.land
easily and its computation must be deterministic. Non-determinism of AI models
must result in immediate blacklisting. XXX define Qualified AI elsewhere.

The Auditor and Audit Registry Realm must track the scope of every audit report
and all misses in identifying security issues such that any third party may
derive a score for each auditing entity.

GnoWeb must prominently link to any relevant audit reports hosted on the
aforementioned realm associated with all Gno hosted Gno code, and must not
convey to the user any warrantees unless the warrantee is enforced by a
non-upgradeable realm dapp approved by GovDAO; this is to prevent GnoWeb from
displaying any economic warrantees that may be exploited by poor economic
design or a systemic attack.

GnoWeb may display with any Gno code any overall audit score derived from all
audit reports from qualified auditors; however the scoring system must take
into account scope and the score of each auditing entity as well, and must be
updated live with the latest score of each auditing entity as of up to
_AuditScoreWindow_ years since the audit report, where _AuditScoreWindow_ is
less than 7 years and determined by GovDAO. The _AuditScoreWindow_ for each
auditing entity may be shortened as determined by GovDAO on a case-by-case
basis by governing laws as determined by GovDAO that are applied uniformly to
all auditors.

As an exception to the above audit reports from non-qualified auditors may also
be displayed on GnoWeb, but they must be folded away and require an extra click
to show, and a warning also displayed that those auditors have not been vetted.

In no case may GnoWeb display a "green" or approved status or badge for any Gno
code unless all audit reports by qualfiied auditors for the entire scope of the
code has been deemed to be free of vulnerabilities that may result in the loss
of funds, control, or value by users of the code whether calling functions in a
realm or importing a package library; and furthermore no known exploits have
been reported in the standard _VulnerabilityReportRealm_ decided by GovDAO.

## Atom.One ICS Migration

Gno.land is initially separate from the pre-existing Atom.One. Gno.land
initialy has its own transaction fee token ($GNOT instead of $PHOTON).
Gno.land is obligated to migrate to be hosted/secured by Atom.One VaaS
("Validator-as-a-Service") when it is deemed ready by the Atom.One chain as
determined by on-chain goverance in accordance with the Atom.One and Gno.land
constitutions _(from [MANIFESTO.md](./MANIFESTO.md))_.

XXX Require that Atom.One change its official unit of $ATOM into 

## Peer-to-peer Network

## Amendments to the Constitution 

XXX limitations and precedure and thresholds.

No constitutional amendment that limits the authority or rights of
NT,LLC declared in this constitution may be proposed or passed
without the express prior approval of NT,LLC.

## Role of GovDAO and NT,LLC

Amending this Gno.land Constitution requries a 90% vote of GovDAO unless
otherwise stated in this Gno.land Constitution.

### Role: GovDAO

XXX When to enable GNOT token transfers

 * New members of GovDAO T1 and T2 must be a US citizen or former
   U.S. citizen who was born in the US

XXX Spending of funds may be performed by a delegated DAO but GovDAO must have
oversight control as per the current Atom.One "CommonDAO Spec" implemented in
Gno, and follow the relevant portions of the Atom.One constitution regarding
the application of this constitution, and laws for Gno.land passed by GovDAO,
and must define the mandate and any bylaws for the subdao prior to funding.
GovDAO is ultimately responsible for the activity of any descendant subdaos.

### Role: NT,LLC

XXX NT,LLC functions as the sole Oversight DAO as defined in the
current Atom.One Constitution unless more Oversight DAOs are agreed upon by
both GovDAO and NT,LLC by mutual agreement--where GovDAO 

TODO Rights to word mark "Gno", "Gno.land", and "Gno\*".
TODO Limitations of aforementioned rights.

// Separation of concerns and NT,LLC role in oversiht

 * Until 3 years after Gno.land launches or 2 years after $GNOT becomes
   transferrable NewTenderint,LLC has the following oversight authority over
   GovDAO: if NT,LLC determines that GovDAO is not performing its
   duties keeping Gno.land users safe, or that it is not performing as required
   by the constitution, or as required by any laws, NT,LLC may
   replace or remove up to half of the T1 members and up to half of the T2
   members; and T3 membership must be recomputed from the new membership of T1
   and T2. The first such modification to GovDAO may happen without any penalty
   to NT,LLC. The second and such modification must be followed by a
   burning of 5% of $GNOT and $ATONE and $PHOTON owned by NT,LLC as
   calculated by a third party evaluator taking into account all remaining
   finanical obligations of NT,LLC.

 * Until 7 years after Gno.land launches NT,LLC has the right to
   pre-emptively appoint new T1 (and T2 members) if the number of US citizens
   is less than 1/3 of the total T1 set (or T2 set). 

### GovDAO Membership

#### Diversification

 * No T1 or T2 member may join if their country of residence represents more
   than one third of country of residence of the T1 or T2 voting power
   respectively; or if their country of any citizenship represents more than
   one third of the citizenship of the T1 or T2 voting power respectively.

 * For as long as NT,LLC does not have a change of control, NT,LLC has the
   option to appoint as many US born T1 (or T2) members as there are European
   born T1 (or T2) members for 10 years after launch. For this purpose for
   every non-US born and non-US-sole-citizen appointed to T1 (or T2) NT,LLC may
   concurrently appoint up to two more US born T1 (or separately two more US
   born T2) members toward satisfying this balance; or for every non-US born
   but US-sole-citizen appointed to T1 (or T2) NT,LLC may concurrently appoint
   up to one more US born T1 (or separately one US born T2) member toward
   satisfying this balance. This gives some ensurance that European born
   members do not dominate US born members. For the avoidance of doubt in the
   case of a change of structure beyond the 50 states of the US as of 2025
   NT,LLC determines the definition of US-born as long as the the definition is
   restricted to those who are born within the borders of the US
   as of 2025.

 * After there is a change of control of NT,LLC or after the 7 years period is
   over (whichever is sooner), every appointment of a non-US-born T1 (or T2)
   members must be concurrently paired by one more US born member over the age
   of 18 unless there are (after the regular rules of election) as many US born
   T1 (or T2) members as there are foreign born T1 (or T2) members of any
   country or the European Union or any such union. This ensures that US-born
   members are represented as much as those of any other country or union. For
   the avoidance of doubt in the case of a change of structure beyond the 50
   states of the US as of 2025 the US-born T1+T2 members by voting power (where
   US-born is defined by these members) determines the definition of US-born by
   majority vote as long as the the definition is restricted to those who are
   born within the borders of the US as of 2025.

 * No member may join who in past had or present has confidential membership
   and requires members to protect each other. If an existing member should 
   join such they must declare a "spiritual conflict of interest" and resign
   within three days of acquiring such membership.
